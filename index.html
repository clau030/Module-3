    <h2>Daily Life</h2>
    <h3>Lola</h3>
        <p>Lola is a one and a half year old rabbit whose <br> hobbies include napping, eating, sleeping, hopping, <br> and napping again.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="20200810_162211.jpg" height="300" alt="Bunny lounging on the floor with her eyes closed"/>
            <figcaption>Lola often sleeps in this position, which is called a "flop".</figcaption>
         </figure>
    <h3>Morning/Afternoon</h3>
        <p>After a waking up in the morning to eat hay and drink water, Lola takes a long snooze <br> under the coffee table. But that doesn't mean she's lazy. Multiple times a day Lola does <br> a cardio workout of running up and down the stairs to stay in shape.</p>

            <figcaption>Another sleeping position is this one, called a "bunny loaf" due to the resemblance to a loaf of bread.</figcaption>
         </figure>
    <h3>Evening/Night</h3>
        <p>Tired from all that running, Lola takes her afternoon siesta, until it's time for dinner.<br> She eats her leafy greens in the evening and prepares for a night of digging up the <br> carpet and chewing on the wooden furniture. All in all, she's had a perfect day.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Lola's diet consists of mostly dry hay, as well as pellets and fresh greens. Her favourite <br> fresh vegetables are kale and basil.</p>
    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
    <p>Bunnies have a relatively short attention span and get bored easily. This means it's <br> important for them to have activities to do. Lola likes to dig on her dog bed and throw <br> objects with her mouth.</p>
